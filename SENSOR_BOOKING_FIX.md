# 🔧 Sensor-Based Booking Logic Fix

## ❌ **The Problem**

### **Scenario:**
1. Person A books Spot A-101 from **11:00 AM to 12:00 PM**
2. At 11:00 AM, A's car parks → Sensor reads **TRUE** (occupied)
3. Person B wants to book the same spot from **1:00 PM to 2:00 PM**
4. **Issue:** Spot appears grayed out/disabled because sensor shows occupied
5. **Result:** B cannot book for 1:00 PM even though spot will be free by then

### **Root Cause:**
The booking system was **disabling spots based on current sensor status**, regardless of the **booking start time**.

```javascript
// OLD LOGIC (WRONG)
if (sensor.obstacle === true) {
    opt.disabled = true;  // ❌ Blocks ALL future bookings
}
```

---

## ✅ **The Solution**

### **New Logic:**
1. **Show sensor status** in dropdown (informational)
2. **Don't disable** the spot selection
3. **Check sensor only for immediate bookings** (starting within 5 minutes)
4. **Allow future bookings** regardless of current sensor status

### **How It Works:**

```javascript
// NEW LOGIC (CORRECT)
if (sensor.obstacle === true) {
    statusText = ' [Currently Occupied]';  // ✅ Show status
    // Don't disable - user might be booking for future
}

// Later, during booking submission:
if (isImmediateBooking) {  // Only if booking starts within 5 min
    if (sensor.obstacle === true) {
        alert('Spot currently occupied');  // ❌ Block only immediate bookings
        return;
    }
}
```

## 🎯 **Booking Flow Now**

### **Case 1: Immediate Booking (Within 5 Minutes)**

**User Action:**
- Current time: 11:00 AM
- Wants to book: 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM (now)
- Spot sensor: TRUE (occupied)

**System Response:**
```
❌ Cannot book spot A-101. 
The spot is currently occupied (sensor detected a vehicle). 
Please choose another spot or try again later.
```

**Result:** ✅ Prevents double booking

---

### **Case 2: Future Booking (More Than 5 Minutes Away)**

**User Action:**
- Current time: 11:00 AM
- Wants to book: 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM (2 hours later)
- Spot sensor: TRUE (occupied by Person A's booking until 12:00 PM)

**System Response:**
```
Dropdown shows: "A-101 - Sec. A [Currently Occupied]"
User can still select it ✅
Booking proceeds normally ✅
```

**Result:** ✅ Allows future booking

---

### **Case 3: Overlapping Booking**

**User Action:**
- Person A has: 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM
- Person B wants: 11:30 AM - 12:30 PM (overlaps)

**System Response:**
```
❌ This spot is already booked for the selected time 
(including 30-minute buffer). Please choose a different 
time or spot.
```

**Result:** ✅ Database constraint prevents overlap

---

## 📊 **Logic Breakdown**

### **Spot Selection (Dropdown):**
```
✅ Show all available spots
✅ Add "[Currently Occupied]" label if sensor = true
✅ Don't disable any spots
✅ User can select any spot for any future time
```

### **Booking Validation:**
```
Step 1: Check if booking is immediate (within 5 min)
  ├─ YES → Check sensor status
  │   ├─ Occupied → ❌ Block booking
  │   └─ Free → ✅ Continue
  └─ NO → ✅ Skip sensor check (future booking)

Step 2: Check database for overlapping bookings
  ├─ Overlap found → ❌ Block booking
  └─ No overlap → ✅ Continue

Step 3: Check user balance
  ├─ Insufficient → ❌ Block booking
  └─ Sufficient → ✅ Create booking
```

## 🔍 **Code Changes**

### **File: `js/booking.js`**

#### **Change 1: Spot Selection (Lines 44-76)**

**Before:**
```javascript
if (sensor.obstacle === true) {
    statusText = ' [Currently Occupied]';
    opt.disabled = true;  // ❌ Disabled spot
    opt.style.color = '#999';
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
if (sensor.obstacle === true) {
    statusText = ' [Currently Occupied]';
    // Don't disable - user might be booking for future
}
```

#### **Change 2: Booking Validation (Lines 179-215)**

**Already Implemented:**
```javascript
// Check if booking starts now or very soon (within 5 minutes)
const timeDiff = (startTime - now) / (1000 * 60);
const isImmediateBooking = timeDiff <= 5;

// If immediate booking, check sensor status
if (isImmediateBooking) {
    // Check sensor and block if occupied
}
// If future booking, skip sensor check
```

## 📅 **Example Scenarios**

### **Scenario A: Sequential Bookings (WORKS NOW ✅)**

```
Timeline:
11:00 AM ────────────── 12:00 PM ────────────── 1:00 PM ────────────── 2:00 PM
         Person A                    [FREE]              Person B
         
At 11:00 AM:
- Spot shows: "A-101 [Currently Occupied]"
- Person B can still select it
- Person B books 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM
- ✅ Booking succeeds
```

### **Scenario B: Overlapping Bookings (BLOCKED ✅)**

```
Timeline:
11:00 AM ────────────── 12:00 PM
         Person A
              └──────── 11:30 AM ────────────── 12:30 PM
                        Person B (OVERLAP!)
                        
- Person B tries to book 11:30 AM - 12:30 PM
- Database detects overlap
- ❌ Booking blocked
```

### **Scenario C: Immediate Booking with Occupied Spot (BLOCKED ✅)**

```
Current Time: 11:00 AM
Person tries to book: 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM (NOW)
Sensor status: TRUE (occupied)

- System checks sensor
- Sensor shows occupied
- ❌ Booking blocked
- Message: "Spot currently occupied"
```

### **Scenario D: Future Booking with Occupied Spot (ALLOWED ✅)**

```
Current Time: 11:00 AM
Person tries to book: 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM (4 hours later)
Sensor status: TRUE (occupied by someone else's current booking)

- System skips sensor check (future booking)
- Checks database for overlaps
- No overlap found
- ✅ Booking succeeds
```

---

## 🎨 **UI Changes**

### **Dropdown Display:**

**Before:**
```
A-101 - Sec. A [Currently Occupied] (grayed out, disabled)
```

**After:**
```
A-101 - Sec. A [Currently Occupied] (normal, selectable)
```

### **User Experience:**

1. User sees spot is currently occupied (informational)
2. User can still select it for future booking
3. System validates based on booking time
4. Clear error messages if booking not allowed

---

## ✅ **Benefits**

### **For Users:**
✅ Can book future slots even if spot is currently occupied  
✅ Clear visibility of current spot status  
✅ No confusion about availability  
✅ Better booking flexibility  

### **For System:**
✅ Sensor data used intelligently  
✅ Prevents actual double bookings  
✅ Allows legitimate future bookings  
✅ Better resource utilization

```

### **Test 2: Immediate Booking with Occupied Spot**
```
✅ Current time: 11:00 AM

```
✅ Existing: 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM
✅ Try to book: 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM
✅ Expected: Booking succeeds
```
