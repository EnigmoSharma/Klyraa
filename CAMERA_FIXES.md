# 🎥 Camera Feed Fixes Applied

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### **1. Admin Camera Feed Not Working**

**Solution:** 
- Changed from `<img>` to `<iframe>` in admin.js

- Disabled all mouse interactions
- Muted audio automatically

### **3. Screenshot Functionality**
**Problem:** Screenshot button wasn't actually capturing the feed.

**Solution:**
- Added `html2canvas` library
- Implemented real screenshot capture
- Screenshots now save to Downloads folder automatically

## 📋 URL Parameters Explained

When you add a YouTube URL, these parameters are automatically added:

```
?autoplay=1          → Video starts automatically
&mute=1              → Audio is muted
&controls=0          → Hide video controls
&modestbranding=1    → Minimal YouTube branding
&rel=0               → Don't show related videos
&showinfo=0          → Hide video info
```

**Example:**
```
Input:  https://www.youtube.com/embed/0FBiyFpV__g
